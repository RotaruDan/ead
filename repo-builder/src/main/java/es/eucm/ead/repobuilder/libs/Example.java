		 * library should be stored and (3) THe library or libraries to
		 * generate.
		 * 
		 * See example in main method below. This will generate several things
		 * as outputs. First, it will create a subfolder called "elements" and
		 * it will put there a zip file containing all binaries and json for
		 * each specific element you creatd. Second, it will also create a
		 * subfolder called "libraries" and it will put there a zip file with
		 * the contents of the library created (just the json for the library
		 * and its thumbnails, nothing else). Finally, it creates a subfolder
		 * "preview" with a zip file. That zip file contains a sample mokap that
		 * lets you preview how your elements will look like on the app.
		 * 
		 * When the generation process completes, the previewer will launch.
		 * Click on "Select directory to scan" and select any file inside the
		 * "preview/" folder. Then hit the button below "previe". This will open
		 * a black screen where the first element is shown. Go back and forth
		 * around elements by clicking the little white circles included.
